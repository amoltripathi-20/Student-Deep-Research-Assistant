# Student-Deep-Research-Assistant


🎓 Student Deep Research Assistant (RAG-Based AI Research Tool)

An AI-powered research assistant that automatically gathers, analyzes, and synthesizes information from web sources and uploaded documents to generate structured research answers using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

This system enables students and researchers to obtain accurate, context-aware explanations by combining LLMs, vector databases, document retrieval, and web search.

🚀 Features
🔎 Automatic Web Research

Uses DuckDuckGo Search to retrieve relevant web sources for the user’s query.

🌐 Website Content Extraction

Extracts useful textual information from web pages using BeautifulSoup.

📄 PDF Document Ingestion

Allows users to upload research papers or notes in PDF format.

Extracts text using PyPDF.

🧠 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Creates embeddings from documents and web content.

Stores them in a Chroma Vector Database.

Retrieves the most relevant chunks to generate accurate responses.

✂️ Intelligent Text Chunking

Splits large documents into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

🔍 Semantic Search

Uses Sentence Transformer embeddings to find semantically similar information.

🤖 AI-Powered Answer Generation

Uses Groq LLM (LLaMA models) to generate structured research responses.

📑 Structured Research Reports

Generates detailed reports including:

Introduction

Key Concepts

Applications

Challenges

Future Scope

Conclusion

📊 Research Progress Visualization

Displays research pipeline stages to the user:

Web search

PDF processing

Vector database creation

Answer generation

🔗 Source Citation

Displays the sources used for generating the answer.

📥 Downloadable Research Report

Users can download the generated research report.
